# The Techronomicon

The purpose of this website/proyect is to bring back from the dead all my hopes that I can become a software engineer, as I feel way out of league given the time and intellect I possess. Thank you. 

Want to create sections, similar to that of any business website. Tabs like "About, contact, merch etc."

Figure out how to add a background picture that is good enough to provide ambiance.
